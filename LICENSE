## 2. THE DATA PRIVACY EXCEPTION (CRITICAL)

To encourage enterprise adoption and protect user privacy, the Licensor (Patrick Heaney) explicitly clarifies the following:

**The "Empty Container" Principle:**
The application of this license applies only to the structure, keys, and logic of the templates and schemas. The specific data, proprietary context, and sensitive information populated within a Value Story by a user (the "Content") is NOT considered a derivative work of the Licensed Material.

- **You OWN your data.**

- Using these templates to store proprietary business logic, private goals, or sensitive context does **NOT** require you to "ShareAlike" that sensitive content.

- You may keep your populated Value Stories private and internal to your organization.
